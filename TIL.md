# Starting a Today I learnt 

To keep track of different emacs hacks I read about and want to get into my workflow.

Global hacks:
    C-x +  balance windows 

In compilation window i.e. compile mode: 
    g - recompiles (runs the same make command as before)
    tab OR M-n - goes to the next error
    ret - goes to the error in source
    
In projectile mode (globally active for me):
    C-c p c - compile project from root - enter the make command in buffer
    C-c p b - switch to buffer of a file in current project
    C-c p k - kills all buffers of that project
